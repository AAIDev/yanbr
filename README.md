[X] Make player collisions actually accurate physics (or good enough)

[X] Add entities that injure/kill/heal the player

[X] Add a death view (where the player becomes a killing entity)

[X] Add a death circle that slowly shrinks

[X] Handle all players dying by ending the game

[X] Make the graphics not _totally_ terrible (better colours, health bar, show alive players/hp)

[X] Make the map much larger

[X] Minimap

[X] When the game ends, add a countdown to start a new one

[X] Waiting list for ongoing games (death view)

[ ] Make the circle shrink at intervals, with a countdown
